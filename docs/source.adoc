== CLI

 ipa test

The test subcommand invokes a test suite on an image in the chosen
public cloud environment. The image id, tests and provider are required
arguments. See below for options:

----
Example: ipa test --ssh-private-key /path/to/key -d SLES Azure test_image
----

 ipa results

The results subcommand displays the test results information. The path
to the results xml is required.

----
Example: ipa results -v
----

The default location for results files is ~/ipa/results/ and the files
are encoded with the timestamp of execution. For example,
the results for an image test in ec2 would be found at
~/ipa/results/ec2/{imageId}/{instanceId}/{datetime}.results.

----
Example results directory:

ec2/:
  ami-43243232/:
    i-3432r4324y3t2/:
      {datetime}.results
    i-432423j3j2432/:
      {datetime}.results
----

 ipa list

The list subcommand displays the available tests.

----
Examples: ipa list
----

The list subcommand will return a list of test files in the default test
directories. The verbose option will return a list of all available
tests in all test files.

----
Example output:

$ ipa list -v

test_broken::test_broken
test_image::test_image
test_sles::test_sles
test_sles::test_sles_1
test_sles::test_sles_2
----

== API

The API used by CLI or used independently, is structured with a base
class in ipa_provider.py. This contains the functionality required to run tests
and collect the test results.

[source,python]
.ipa_provider.py
----
class IpaProvider(object):
...
----

The base class is extended for each provider to implement specific
methods for manipulating the test instance.

[source,python]
.ipa_{cloud-provider}.py
----
class {CloudProvider}Provider(IpaProvider):
...
----

The controller (ipa_controller.py) provides methods for testing an image,
displaying available tests and/or test files and displaying results of a
previous test run. These methods provide a layer between the CLI and the
API. They also provide an entry point for using *ipa* directly from code.

[source,python]
.ipa_controller.py
----
def test_image(self):
    """Creates a cloud provider instance and initiates testing."""

def list_tests(self):
    """Returns a list of test files and/or tests."""

def collect_results(self):
    """Returns the result (pass/fail) or verbose results."""
